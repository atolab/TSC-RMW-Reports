2021/10/11 10:03:56 PM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,"multiple-robots, one RCS, communicating using WiFi or 5G",Yes,Several data transport issues were found using Fast DDS. All the issues were solved by switching to Cyclone DDS.,Cyclone DDS,9,9,Overall Cyclone DDS seems to provide better performance in terms of latency and jitter when using large number of topics or nodes.,Refer to previous answers,,,,
2021/10/12 2:33:51 AM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,one robot communicating over local network,Yes,,Cyclone DDS,9,9,,,,,,
2021/10/12 4:42:18 AM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,Multiple autonomous robots,No,- ,Fast DDS,,,,,8,7,-,-
2021/10/12 5:16:43 AM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,"One or multiple robots, over WiFi for development and loopback for production.",No,,Fast DDS,,,,,5,7,,
2021/10/12 5:50:27 AM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,We are using mainly micro-ROS to send commands and get data from our swarm of tiny drones (Crazyflie 2.1). We use a custom transport of the micro-ROS agent that bridges the comunication over wifi (2.4GHz) with the drones.,No,,Fast DDS,,,,,8,10,Good suport from the eProsima team.,I did not have experience with Cyclone DDS
2021/10/12 10:25:55 AM MDT,ROS 2 Galactic Geochelone,Local only use of ROS2 on mobile robots  (not network communication),Yes,,Cyclone DDS,9,9,Many issues solved by switching from Fast DDS to Cyclone during the foxy->galactic transition,"Many issues with Fast DDS on services, action, components and localhost only config + high CPU usage",,,,
2021/10/12 12:37:25 PM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,one and multi robots communicating in wifi,Yes,,Cyclone DDS,9,8,,,,,,
2021/10/12 12:40:19 PM MDT,ROS 2 Galactic Geochelone,"Marine robots (mostly ROVs, AUVs, ASVs, and camera/sensing stations) that use ROS2 internally to communicate between software elements, as well as to communicate with external robots and software systems. These robots can either remain disconnected from any other system to operate in an autonomous fashion, or can be connected over tethers, wireless interfaces, etc to communicate with one or more local ground control stations, other robots, or cloud services. Non-ROS2 protocols/tech are used to form connections over WAN interfaces like public LTE networks.",Yes,"At this stage, CycloneDDS and FastDDS are similar enough from a technical and performance standpoint that my evaluation has shifted more towards a qualitative evaluation of the organizations/developers behind the implementation, particularly with respect to how eager and responsive the developers are to accommodating the needs and requests of the community. I should note that we still internally use RTI Connext as our ""mission critical/battle hardened"" DDS vendor of choice for the most important components of our stack (these being pure DDS and not ROS2-based), having almost eight years of experience and success with their product. We use CycloneDDS as the vendor of choice for all ROS2-based development and for all user-space environments, libraries/SDKs that we develop, and open source work. These choices are things that we reflect upon multiple times throughout the year as the open source implementations become increasingly mature.",Cyclone DDS,9,10,"As I mentioned, both CycloneDDS and FastDDS are now similar enough (from my perspective and needs) technically that, at the current moment, I don't have any strong arguments for or against either. That said, simply by virtue of regularly using CycloneDDS, I've found it to be a solid implementation for its role within our stack, and more importantly, I've really enjoyed the process of working with the multiple teams that support all of the efforts that tie together under the Eclipse Foundation to provide value add to Cyclone and, I believe, ROS2 as a whole. This includes the efforts from the folks at ADLINK and otherwise relating to CycloneDDS, IceOryx, and Zenoh, all of which have found a place in our ROS2 and DDS environment. All of my interactions with various individuals within these groups and projects has been very positive, and they have shown a level of eagerness to help and support their users that I've generally found to be rare.","I don't have anything negative to say about FastDDS. I attempted to use their implementation in the Dashing and pre-Dashing days and had some issues, which led us to switch to first the Connext RMW and then to Cyclone, but I now know these issues to be fully resolved in a way that would likely make their implementation just as viable for our company's efforts, in purely technical terms. At this point, our working relationship with RTI and CycloneDDS, and our technical success using their software, simply creates a level of inertia and switching-costs that erodes any desire to continuously evaluate middleware vendors in the absence of any truly game-changing features between them.",,,,

2021/10/12 9:20:08 PM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,"one host one robot, communicating over private 5G network",Yes,,Cyclone DDS,6,7,,,,,,
2021/10/13 5:56:55 AM MDT,ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy,autonomous racing  vehicle,Yes,liked Cyclone DDS better. Open source,Cyclone DDS,9,9,like the dev plan for it.,,,,,
